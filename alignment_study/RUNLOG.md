# Scale round run log

Session 1 (2026-09-01, free Colab T4): scale_round.py ran as registered.
Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B completed all 12 windows; its per-layer block was captured
from the cell output and stored as scale_partial/qwen2.5-3b_capture.json.
The runtime was reclaimed by Colab about 65 minutes in, during window 4 of
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct; results for the remaining four models
were lost with the VM (scale_round.json was never retrievable).

Deviation for session 2: scale_round_v2.py reimplements the identical
registered protocol with vectorized surrogate generation (numpy
Generator.permuted over draws x heads per row) and GPU commutator norms
in float32. Surrogate distributions are unchanged; the concrete random
draws differ from v1's stream because the RNG call order differs; the
commutator norms move from float64 to float32, far below draw noise.
Validation against the development model (layers 2, 11, 20, stride-40
windows): real, plain, sinkfix, altsink-v2, and zmed statistics match
tier1_robust.json within window-subset variation, e.g. layer 20 alt2
0.971 (v2) vs 0.974 (tier1), layer 11 alt2 0.985 vs 0.986. A direct
same-window comparison of the two altsink implementations agreed to
three decimals. Model order for session 2 puts the 7B models first so
the highest-value results bank earliest if the session is reclaimed;
per-model results print as MODEL_RESULT blocks for progressive capture.
Evaluation of S1-S4 merges the captured session-1 Qwen2.5-3B block with
the session-2 models.

Session 3 (same day): scale_round_v2.py with the two remaining models
completed both (Phi-3-mini, OLMo-2-7B) in about 18 minutes. All five
registered models are therefore complete across three sessions. Per-model
blocks were captured from cell output into scale_partial/ (the script
rounds aggregates to 4 decimals before printing, so the captured blocks
are the complete output, not truncations). Session 2 was reclaimed during
OLMo's 29 GB download; no computed results were lost across the three
sessions. Evaluation: eval_scale_round.py -> scale_round_results.json.

Local platform (2026-09-10). From this date runs execute on the author's
Apple M1 Max (32 GB unified memory, MPS working set 21.3 GB) through torch
MPS, with the device and precision policy in hubsfree/adapters.py: float32
whenever 4 x parameters <= 0.75 x working set (about 4B parameters on this
machine), bfloat16 above; float16 is excluded because Qwen2.5 attention
overflows to NaN in float16 on MPS. Fidelity (platform_fidelity.py ->
platform_fidelity.json; Qwen2.5-1.5B, 12 windows, T = 64, 28 layers, 20
high-sink): MPS float32 reproduces the CPU float32 layer medians of sink
mass, r1, shared energy and cos(S, sink) to four decimals with 0 of 336
sink-column changes, at 68 ms per window against 382 ms on CPU. MPS
bfloat16 deviates by at most 0.055 (r1), 0.019 (shared energy) and 0.020
(cos) over all layers, 0.048, 0.007 and 0.003 over high-sink layers, with
6 of 336 sink-column changes, at 89 ms per window. The registered anchor
check (scale_round_v2.py --validate, Qwen2.5-0.5B, layers 2/11/20, six
windows) agrees between CPU and MPS float32 on every printed statistic to
four decimals except zmed at layer 20 (10.9165 against 10.9166).
Consequence for the 3B to 7B set: Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-mini run in float32
locally; Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-7B and OLMo-2-7B run in bfloat16 as on the T4.
